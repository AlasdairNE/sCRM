Under the **Stochastic Mode**, the species' **Body Length** (metres) and **Wingspan**
(metres) are treated as random variables, with each defined by a **Mean**
and a standard deviation (**SD**) and assumed to follow a Trunc. Normal Distribution
bounded at 0.

Both body dimensions are taken as point estimates when **deterministic mode** is
enabled, with only **Mean** values required.
