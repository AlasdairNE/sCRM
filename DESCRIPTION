Description: A Shiny App for a stochastic Collision Risk Model (sCRM) for seabirds. CRMs are used to understand potential wind farm effects on seabirds by estimating collision mortality. This Shiny app provides an user interface for the stochastic version of the Band (2012) offshore CRM, based on an updated, and streamlined, version of Masden's (2015) R program. sCRM allows for uncertainty/variability in input parameters to be propagated to predicted collision numbers.
