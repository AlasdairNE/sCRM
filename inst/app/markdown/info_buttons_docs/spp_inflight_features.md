The **Proportion of upwind flights** is likely to be 0.5 for most species,
unless local data indicate a prevalent direction of travel relative to predominant
winds.

The following features are treated as random variables under the **Stochastic Mode**, 
each defined by a **Mean** and a standard deviation (**SD**), or as
point estimates when **Deterministic Mode** is enabled (i.e. only **Mean** is required):

- **Flight Speed**, in metres/second (Trunc. Normal bounded at 0)

- **Nocturnal Activity**, expressed as a proportion of daytime flight activity
levels (Beta distributed)

- **Basic Avoidance** rate (for Option 1 and 2) and **Extended Avoidance** rate
(for Option 3 and 4), expressing the probability that a bird flying on a
collision course with a turbine will take evading action (Beta distributed)

- **Proportion** of flights **at Collision Risk Height (CRH)** derived from site
survey data (Beta distributed). Used in Option 1 calculations.
