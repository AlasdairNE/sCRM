Specify the species' **Flight height distribution**(s) (FHD), i.e. the relative
frequency of flights at 1-metre height bands, between 0m and 500m. 

At least one of the following must be supplied:

- A **Generic FHD** derived from country-level or regional-level data. Required
for Option 3 calculations.

- A **Site-specific FHD** based on local survey data. Required for Option 4
calculations.

**Stochastic Mode** requires Bootstrap samples of the species' FHD.
**Deterministic Mode** expects point estimates of FHD.

For **Generic FHD** users can either use estimates from Johnson et al. (2014) or
upload an alternative data set.
