In **Stochastic Mode**, uncertainty in blade pitch and rotation speed can be specified in two ways: 

1. Treated as random variables, each defined by **Mean** and a standard
deviation (**SD**) and assumed to follow a **Truncated Normal Distribution**,
bounded at 0.

2. Governed by a relationship with **Wind Speed**, in metres/second, which is treated as a random
variable following a truncated Normal distribution bounded at 0.

In **Deterministic Mode**, blade pitch and rotation speed are solely specified
as point estimates - i.e. only **Mean** values required.
