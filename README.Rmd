## Overview

_NB: This is a repo for a work-in-progress sCRM Shiny app intended to replace the current [stochCRM](https://github.com/dmpstats/stochCRM) app. The updated implementation aims to the further development of the sCRM app in terms of additional simulation and output features, combined with a major code refactoring process to improve production-level capacity._

_In the meantime, please use the currently active [stochCRM](https://github.com/dmpstats/stochCRM) app. Thank you!_


Collision Risk Models (CRMs) are used to understand potential wind farm effects on seabirds by estimating collision mortality. 

__sCRM__ is a Shiny app providing an user interface for the stochastic version of the Band (2012) offshore CRM, based on an updated, and streamlined, version of Masden's (2015) R program. sCRM allows for uncertainty/variability in input parameters to be propagated to predicted collision numbers.





## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of sCRM from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- #install.packages("sCRM") -->
<!-- 1:10 -->
<!-- ``` -->

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

<!-- ```{r example} -->
<!-- #library(sCRM) -->
<!-- print("yes") -->
<!-- ## basic example code -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
