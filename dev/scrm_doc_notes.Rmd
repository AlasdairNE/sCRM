## TO DO's

- Document the modular structure of the app

- Document the structure of the data feeding into the sCRM simulations

- Document modules in a vignette(?)

- FHD: Make clear that, if only survey FHD are specified, option 2 calculations
use survey FHD. This should probably go on the info button.

- Monthly Operation: refer that if data is not specified for a month in one of
the downtime or wind availability datasets, then there will be no operation
figures for that month
