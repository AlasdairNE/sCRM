Set values for parameters related to the wind farm turbines:

- **Number of rotor blades** in each turbine.

- **Rotor Radius**: the distance from the axis of rotation to blade tip, in
metres.


- **Air Gap**: tip clearance gap, in metres, i.e. the distance between the minimum
blade tip height and the highest astronomical tide at the site.


- **Maximum Blade Width**: the maximum width of the rotor blade (i.e. the maximum
blade chord), in metres.


- **Blade Pitch** angle, i.e. the angle between the blade surface and the rotor
plane, in degrees.


- The operational **Rotation Speed**, in number of revolutions per minute.
